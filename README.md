Inventory Management System - Python Edition 🛒📦
Welcome to my Inventory Management System! It’s like the superhero of inventory tracking – except it’s built with Python and doesn’t wear a cape (well, maybe just virtually 😉).

This project demonstrates two different ways to manage inventory:

The Fancy Way with JSON – Because we love structure in our lives, right?
The Simpler Way with a Text File – A bit old school, but it gets the job done!
What It Does
✔️ Manages product stock (because no one likes running out of toilet paper 🧻)
✔️ Handles sales transactions automatically (no more "oops, I forgot to update the inventory" moments)
✔️ Keeps a detailed log of all purchases, so no more scrambling to remember what was sold last week. 🧾

How It Works
JSON Version: Uses the json module to store and modify product data with ease. Best for when you want to feel like a data wizard. 🧙‍♂️
Text File Version: Relies on good ol' file handling, making it as straightforward as reading a receipt. 🧾
Features
View available products
Update inventory automatically after each sale
Track sales history with timestamps 🕒
Bonus: Handles both large inventories and small lists (no judgment if you’re still using a small dataset 😎).
Why Two Approaches?
Because why settle for one when you can do both?! 🤷‍♂️

JSON is great for structured data and scalability.
Text files are perfect for those who love simplicity and don’t need all the bells and whistles (aka me at 2 AM). 😴
